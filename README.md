## This is my first website 1.0.4

The main purpose of this website was to have a place where I could show case all my projects. Basically a website that could share with anyone interested in my work.

Of course in the future I plan to have a nice portfolio to show my best projects, but I donâ€™t thing I will create that one at least until I learn React js.

So, I did not put a lot of effort in the design of this website, I just want it to be very simple. I finish this project in one day.

It was of course it has some JavaScript functionalities, like the sidebar or modal with the contact form.
I set the form with [Formspree](https://formspree.io/). 

### Dark Mode
